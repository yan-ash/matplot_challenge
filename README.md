#### Part 1: Summary Statistics
We could see the data sumarization, it shows us the mean, median, standard deviation and SEM of the tumour volumn for each drug regimen.

#### Part 2: Bar Charts and a Pie Charts
a. It is a demonstration of the total time points for each drug regimen, obivously, "Capomulin" accounted the most. 
b. In the study, the distribution of the male and female mice are almost even. The male number is slightly higher.

#### Part 3: Calculate, and Create a Box Quartiles, Find OutliersPlot 

In this part, we focus on the four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol and Ceftamin. From the box plot, we could see the last time points for Capomulin, Ramicane,  Ceftamin are within the regular normal range except one of Infubinol is below the lower bound.

#### Part 4 Line Plot

As it is shown in the line chart, the Mouse (ID: s185) treated with Capomulin, the tumour volumn goes down with more timepoints.
Therefore, we can say Capomulin is very effective in treating tumours.

#### Part 5 Scatter Plot, Correlation and Regression
It is an analysis to find out if the mouse weight plays an important role in developing the tumour while treated with Capomulin.
 From the scatter plot, we could see there is a close relationship between the two factors. It clearly shows that the tumour volumn goes up with the weight of mouse.
